  # a high velocity and observing how quickly the temperature drops.
  #
  # You should manually run `sensors -j` and ensure that every device
  # that has a temperature is somewhow included in the calculation of
  # at least one fan speed.  Note that drivetemp devices may already
  # be included via $*_drives averages below.

  my $right_cpu = $sensors_ref->{"coretemp-isa-0001"}{"Package id 1"}{"temp1_input"}; # fan4;

  # You might want to factor in NVME drives too, that might appear
  # through the `sensors -j` structure as eg:
  # $sensors_ref->{"nvme-pci-0100"}{"temp composite Samsung-EVO-970-1TB"}{"temp1_input"}
  #
  # You might find that while "temp composite Samsung-EVO-970-1TB"
  # (heatsink) is the bit you're cooling, "temp sensor 2
  # Samsung-EVO-970-1TB" (maybe the silicon itself) is uncomfortably
  # higher than the composite reading.  So monitor that hotter sensor
  # instead to add more fan demand.

  # For the drives, there's no need to map each /dev/sd? onto their
  # dynamic positioning inside the chassis.  Just code each path as it
  # maps from /dev/disk/by-path to how it appears on your backplane
  # physically.  I used: `dd if=/dev/disk/by-path/.... of=/dev/null`
  # to work out the pattern that's appropriate to my LFF R730XD (4x3
  # 3.5" drives at front, 2 2.5" drives at rear; hence why I don't
  # know which of 12 and 13 are left or right rear - I can't pull my
  # machine out far enough to watch the blinkenlights).  The averages
  # disregard any drives that are not present or spundown and
  # inaccessible to SMART temperature sensing (the daemon will
  # fallback to idrac control if you define a mapping where one fan
  # doesn't cool *any devices*.  If you were sure there was nothing
  # that could be cooled from that fan (no PCIe cards, no CPU or RAM
  # in right hand socket, no drives on right hand side, no drac, no
  # RAID controller, etc), you could just set weighted_temp to 1 (not
  # 0 - that's still an error).

  # So let's calculate the average temperatures of drives in each
  # vertical arrangement (the rear drives draw their airflow from the
  # two leftmost fans, so just average them).  If you have 2.5" SFF
  # drive backplane, or a 1RU chassis, or..., your calculation will be
